## Purpose
Enable a 3D globe with terrain/imagery and geodesic camera behavior.

## Data
- Terrain (optional) + imagery layers from Tile Source Manager.
- 3D Tiles (buildings/trees) attach as separate layers but share camera & culling.

## Style
- Atmosphere toggles, lighting, shadows (if enabled), water/terrain exaggeration.
- Imagery same as 2D but composited on ellipsoid/terrain.

## Interactions
- Geodesic distances for measure; pick terrain heights; drill-pick 3D Tiles above terrain.

## Camera
- Ellipsoid-aware or terrain-following flights; horizon & fog for depth cues.

## Performance
- Screen-space error (SSE) for terrain & 3D Tiles; horizon culling; texture reuse.

## Observability
- `uv.globe.mode.enter|exit`, `uv.globe.terrain.enabled`, `uv.globe.sse.changed`

## Acceptance
- 2Dâ†”3D switch retains selection/camera context within epsilon.
- Terrain SSE target keeps frame under budget in perf scenes.
