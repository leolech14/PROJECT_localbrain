## Scope
AI Control Plane, Universal Control Contract (UCC), Control Reflection Protocol (CRP),
LocalBrain Bridge, UV Intent Schema, AI Policy Limits, AI User Access & Roles, Voice HUD.

## Acceptance demos (for 'complete')
1. **Any-Control Preview** — LLM requests to "increase hillshade intensity to 0.8". UCC maps to `Style Panel → Raster → hillshade.intensity`. CRP returns a **dry-run diff**; HUD shows chip **Preview/Do/Explain**; commit updates under 100 ms; undo works.
2. **Scoped Session** — Create an **AI session** with role `Analyst-Lite` (read/visual/style only). Attempt to delete a layer → **denied** with prompt; style edits succeed; audit shows decisions.
3. **Plan Signing** — Multi-step plan ("load CSV→create chart→brush top decile→fit camera"). Planner emits a signed plan with CID; execution generates `uv.ai.plan.start|end` and per-step `uv.op.*` events; replay reproduces results deterministically.
4. **Control Discovery** — LLM asks "What can you change here?" CRP enumerates controls for active panel with **CCD descriptors**; list is summarized and vocalized; selecting an item focuses the widget and highlights the control.
5. **Dangerous Action Gate** — "Delete tileset layer" requires double-confirm with reason; HUD shows **Confirm with reason**; policy logs include reason; undo works and audit captures both actions.
6. **Cross-Widget Coordination** — "Color buildings by height deciles and update legend" changes both layer style and legend widget; both controls are driven via UCC with consistent timing and a single plan CID.

## Perf/Safety gates
- Control reflection query ≤ 30 ms p95; cached per widget version.
- Plan compile ≤ 100 ms typical; per-step preview ≤ 80 ms.
- HUD open/interaction ≤ 16/50 ms.
- Session cap: idle timeout default 15 min; memory footprint bounded; no render-loop stalls.

## Observability checks
- Events: `uv.ai.session.open|close`, `uv.ai.intent`, `uv.ai.plan.start|end|cancel`, `uv.ai.preview`, `uv.ai.commit`, `uv.ai.denied`, `uv.ai.explain`, `uv.ai.control.reflect`.
- Metrics: intent→plan latency, preview/commit ms, denial rates, session durations, dangerous-action confirmations.

## Risks & mitigations
- Ambiguity → **explain + preview** mandatory; require explicit control disambiguation when multiple matches.
- Escalation misuse → role-scoped sessions + reason‑required confirmation for destructive ops; audit NDJSON export.
