## Purpose
Ship a discoverable docs site with versioned API, tutorials, and sample scenes.

## Structure
- **Getting Started**, **Concepts** (Scene/Layer/Style/Transform), **Howâ€‘tos**, **Reference** (Schema/API), **Samples** (downloadable `.uvscene.json`).

## Tooling
- Static site (Docusaurus/MkDocs); versioned; search; link check; size budgets.
- Snippets verified in CI (doctests where feasible).

## Samples
- Curated scenes per batch; screenshots; expected outputs for tests.

## Observability
- `uv.docs.build.start|end`, `uv.docs.linkcheck.fail`.

## Acceptance
- Docs build without broken links; sample scenes open and reproduce screenshots.
