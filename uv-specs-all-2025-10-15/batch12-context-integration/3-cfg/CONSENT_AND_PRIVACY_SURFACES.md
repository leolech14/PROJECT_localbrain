## Principles
- Explicit optâ€‘in; clear value; reversible at any time; minimal data; redaction by default.

## Surfaces
- **First-run modal** with choices (Off/On granular), links to policy; defaults Off.
- **Settings** reflect state; quick toggle; explain sampling and categories.
- **Per-feature prompts** (e.g., crash reports) with clear scope and persistence choice.

## Data
- No PII; file paths redacted; provider keys never transmitted; metrics aggregated/sampled.

## Observability
- `uv.consent.prompt.shown|accepted|declined`, category toggles.

## Acceptance
- Consent decisions persisted; exports reflect redaction; disabling stops further sends immediately.
