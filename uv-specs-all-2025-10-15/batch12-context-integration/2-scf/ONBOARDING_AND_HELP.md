## Objectives
Make first 10 minutes productive: explain canvas, layers, panel schema, and command palette.

## Elements
- **First-run tour**: 5â€“7 steps; keyboard-first; reduced motion variant.
- **Context tips**: subtle hints the first time you open a panel or use a tool.
- **Help panel**: searchable docs; deep links to website; sample scenes open in one click.

## Integration
- Command Palette exposes commands for tour, tips, and help searches.

## Observability
- `uv.onboarding.tour.start|end|skip`, `uv.help.search`

## Acceptance
- Tour completion rate tracked; help search < 100 ms; tips never block interactions.
