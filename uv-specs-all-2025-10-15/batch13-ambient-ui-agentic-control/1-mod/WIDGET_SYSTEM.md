## Purpose
Provide free-floating widgets (windows) that host panels, charts, minimaps, or custom plugin UIs.

## Behavior
- Create/close, drag, resize, snap, dock to sidebar; z-order with keyboard cycling.
- Adaptive layouts: widgets can switch compact/full modes; publish preferred sizes.
- Persistence: layout saved in `.uvscene.json` in `widgets[]` with positions/sizes/z.

## Types
- Core widgets: Style, Data, Inspector, Logs/Perf, Mini-Map, Chart, Console, Extensions.
- Plugin widgets: read-only panels with UI schema components (security constraints).

## Performance
- Virtualized widget tree; single compositor; opacity and transforms in GPU.

## Observability
- `uv.widget.create|focus|move|resize|dock|close`

## Acceptance
- 8 widgets interactively managed at â‰¥ 45 FPS; layout persists and restores exactly.
