## Purpose
Provide a built-in console for structured events and performance metrics, tied to
the Observability Spec (Batch 0).

## Views
- **Events**: filter by namespace/severity; copy as JSON; pin queries.
- **Metrics**: frame time, draw calls, VRAM, IO latency, cache hit rate; mini charts.
- **Warnings**: provider quotas, CRS mismatches, memory guards, dropped frames.

## Features
- Correlation IDs; export logs to NDJSON; redaction toggle for file paths.
- Snapshot: capture last N seconds of metrics for bug reports.

## Observability
- `uv.panel.logs.opened|closed`, `uv.panel.logs.exported`, `uv.obs.sampling.changed`.

## Acceptance
- 5k events/minute remain navigable; metrics charts update at 2â€“4 Hz without jank.
