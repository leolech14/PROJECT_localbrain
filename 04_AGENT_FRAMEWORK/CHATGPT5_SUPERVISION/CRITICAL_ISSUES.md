# Critical Issues & Blockers

## üö® Issues Requiring ChatGPT-5 Supervision

### 1. Strategic Priority Decisions
**Status**: Awaiting Supervisor Decision
**Impact**: HIGH - Determines project direction for next phase

**Issue**:
- Current spec compliance is only 25%
- Critical components missing (Agent Panel, Security, Search)
- Need decision on parallel execution priorities

**Questions for ChatGPT-5**:
1. Should Agent A focus on Agent Communication Panel first, or Security Model?
2. Should Agent B work on refining existing specs, or focus on test planning?
3. How should we balance speed vs. quality given the low compliance rate?

**Options**:
- **Option A**: Focus on Agent Panel first (enables agent integration)
- **Option B**: Focus on Security first (foundational requirement)
- **Option C**: Work in parallel on both (requires more coordination)

### 2. Architecture Decision: Swift Backend Integration
**Status**: Awaiting Technical Direction
**Impact**: HIGH - Affects all future development

**Issue**:
- Next.js frontend exists but Swift backend integration incomplete
- IPC bridge has fallback handlers instead of real backend communication
- Need decision on integration approach

**Questions for ChatGPT-5**:
1. Should we pause frontend development until backend integration is complete?
2. Should we continue with mock implementations and replace with real calls later?
3. Should Agent A focus on backend integration or continue frontend work?

**Technical Context**:
- Swift backend has complete services (AI, RAG, Keychain)
- IPC bridge exists but needs real handler implementation
- Frontend components expect API responses that aren't available

### 3. Resource Allocation: Parallel Execution Strategy
**Status**: Awaiting Coordination Decision
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Affects agent efficiency and timeline

**Issue**:
- Agents A & B have different work styles and capabilities
- Need clear separation of responsibilities to avoid conflicts
- Agent C needs guidance on validation priorities

**Questions for ChatGPT-5**:
1. How detailed should task assignments be for Agents A & B?
2. Should Agent C validate work continuously or at milestones?
3. How should we handle dependencies between Agent A and B work?

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Blockers

### 1. No Real Agent Backend Integration
**Status**: Complete Blocker
**Component**: Agent Communication Panel
**Impact**: Agent Panel cannot function without backend

**Details**:
- Agent Panel requires real agent API endpoints
- Current implementation only has mock handlers
- Swift backend has agent services but no IPC bridge

**Resolution Required**:
- Implement IPC handlers for agent communication
- Connect Next.js frontend to Swift backend agent services
- Test end-to-end agent communication flow

### 2. No Authentication/Authorization System
**Status**: Complete Blocker
**Component**: Security Model
**Impact**: Cannot implement permission-based access

**Details**:
- No user authentication system
- No role-based access control
- No session management

**Resolution Required**:
- Implement authentication context and providers
- Create user management system
- Add permission checking middleware

### 3. No State Persistence
**Status**: Partial Blocker
**Component**: Module Management
**Impact**: User work not saved between sessions

**Details**:
- Module positions not saved
- User preferences not persisted
- Conversation history lost on refresh

**Resolution Required**:
- Implement local storage for user preferences
- Add database persistence for module state
- Create session management system

## üîÑ Coordination Issues

### 1. Agent Task Assignment Clarity
**Status**: Resolved (framework created)
**Resolution**: Clear task assignments created for each agent

### 2. Quality Validation Process
**Status**: Partially Resolved
**Resolution**: Agent C oversight framework established
**Remaining**: Define validation triggers and frequency

### 3. Supervisor Context Management
**Status**: Resolved
**Resolution**: ChatGPT-5 supervision directory created and organized

## üìä Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISK Issues
1. **Backend Integration Gap** - Could delay project significantly
2. **Security Implementation** - Could require major architectural changes
3. **Agent Coordination** - Could lead to conflicts or duplicated work

### MEDIUM RISK Issues
1. **Quality Validation** - Could impact code quality and compliance
2. **State Management** - Could affect user experience
3. **Performance Optimization** - Could affect system responsiveness

### LOW RISK Issues
1. **Documentation Updates** - Can be handled incrementally
2. **Test Coverage** - Can be improved gradually
3. **Minor UI Polish** - Can be added iteratively

## üéØ Immediate Action Items

### For ChatGPT-5 (Supervisor)
1. **Review Critical Issues** - Make strategic decisions on priorities
2. **Approve Task Assignments** - Validate Agent A & B responsibilities
3. **Resolve Architecture Questions** - Decide on integration approach
4. **Set Quality Standards** - Define validation criteria and process

### For Human (Lech)
1. **Review Supervisor Decisions** - Provide HITL input on strategic choices
2. **Approve Resource Allocation** - Confirm agent task assignments
3. **Resolve Technical Trade-offs** - Make decisions on architectural approaches
4. **Validate Timeline** - Confirm project priorities and schedule

### For Agents A, B, C
1. **Begin Assigned Tasks** - Start work on approved priorities
2. **Document Progress** - Update status files regularly
3. **Report Blockers** - Escalate issues through proper channels
4. **Maintain Quality** - Follow established validation process
