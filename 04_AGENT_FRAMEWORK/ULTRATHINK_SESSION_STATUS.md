   - Extracts metadata (size, dates, hash)
   - Stores in database
   - Generates statistics
   - **Tested**: ✅ Scans and categorizes correctly

3. ✅ **AgentRecognizer** (T003) - 350 LOC
   - Recognizes agents via tracking ID (100% confidence)
   - Recognizes agents via model signature (90% confidence)
   - Creates new agents automatically
   - Stores tracking ID in ~/.brain/config.json
   - Loads session history
   - Extracts capabilities from model
   - **Tested**: ✅ Recognized agent by signature

4. ✅ **JobProposalEngine** (T004) - 250 LOC
   - 6-factor task scoring (role, capability, history, context, readiness, urgency)
   - Intelligent task-agent matching
   - Finds relevant context automatically
   - Ranks proposals by score
   - **Tested**: ✅ Generates ranked proposals

5. ✅ **DiscoveryEngine** (T005) - 200 LOC
   - Orchestrates all 4 components
   - Complete plug-n-play flow
   - Returns full environment package
   - Beautiful console output
   - **Tested**: ✅ Full flow working

**Total**: ~1,500 LOC implemented in 5 hours!

### **3. Database Schema Extended** ✅
**Migrations**: 3 new migrations (003, 004, 005)

- ✅ **Migration 003**: Projects table (multi-project support)
- ✅ **Migration 004**: Agents table (persistent identity)
- ✅ **Migration 005**: Context files table (context storage)

**Database Now Has**: 11 tables total
```
Original (8 tables):
├─ tasks, task_history, migrations
├─ agent_sessions, agent_activity
├─ agent_presence, agent_metrics
└─ agent_collaboration

New (3 tables):
├─ projects (multi-project registry)
├─ agents (persistent identity)
└─ context_files (extracted context)
```

### **4. MCP Tool Created** ✅
**Tool**: `discover_environment` (11th tool)

**What It Does**:
```bash
# Agent calls discover_environment
{
  "cwd": "/Users/lech/PROJECTS_all/LocalBrain",
  "modelId": "claude-sonnet-4-5"
}

# System automatically:
✅ Recognizes or creates agent
✅ Detects project (LocalBrain)
✅ Extracts context (scans all files)
✅ Generates job proposals (ranked tasks)
✅ Returns complete environment package

# All in one call!
```

### **5. Test Suite Created** ✅
**File**: `test-discovery-engine.cjs`

**Tests**:
- Agent recognition (new and existing)
- Project detection
- Context extraction
- Job proposal generation
- Plug-n-play flow

**Results**: ✅ WORKING (needs performance optimization)

✅ Scans directories: specs, docs, code, architecture
✅ Categorizes files: SPEC, DOC, CODE, etc.
✅ Generates proposals: Ranked list of tasks
✅ Returns complete package: Ready to work!

Total time: ~20-60 seconds (needs optimization)
Manual steps: ZERO
```

### **Multi-Project Support** ✅

```
Database supports:
✅ Unlimited projects
✅ Project isolation
✅ Separate task lists
✅ Separate context
✅ Project-scoped queries

Ready for:
✅ LocalBrain
✅ AudioAnalyzer
✅ ProfilePro
✅ Gov.br
✅ All 60+ projects in PROJECTS_all/
```

### **Persistent Agent Identity** ✅

```
Agents are recognized via:
✅ Tracking ID (100% confidence)
✅ Model signature (90% confidence)
✅ Session history loaded
✅ Capabilities extracted
✅ Stats tracked (sessions, tasks, velocity)

Config stored: ~/.brain/config.json
Database tracking: Full history
```

## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES

### **Issue #1: Context Extraction Performance**
```
Problem: Scanning large projects takes >60 seconds
Impact: Timeout on first connection
Workaround: Cache context after first scan
Solution: Optimize scanning, add progress reporting
Priority: P1 (works but slow)
Effort: 2 hours
```

### **Issue #2: No Cloud Deployment Yet**
```
Problem: Still running locally (not on Railway)
Impact: Can't use from multiple machines
Workaround: Works locally for development
Solution: T006 - Deploy to Railway
Priority: P0 for multi-machine use
Effort: 2 hours
```

### **Issue #3: No CLI Tool Yet**
```
Problem: No "brain connect" command
Impact: Must use MCP tools directly
Workaround: Use test scripts
Solution: T017-T020 - Build CLI
Priority: P0 for user experience
Effort: 20 hours
```
