## 🎯 WHAT YOU HAVE

### The System (ULTRATHINK Verified ✅)

```
LECH + AGENT F (Meta-Config/Admin)
       ↕️ (Manages)
CENTRAL COORDINATOR (Brain)
       ☎️ Telephone Line
       ↕️
AGENTS A, B, C, D, E (Field Workers)

---

## ⚡ QUICK START (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Start Coordinator (1 minute)

```bash
cd /Users/lech/PROJECTS_all/LocalBrain/04_AGENT_FRAMEWORK
./start-coordinator.sh
```

**Wait for**:
```
🧠 CENTRAL COORDINATOR - Keep-In-Touch System
✅ Server running on port 3000
Ready to manage agent lifecycles!
```

**✅ Coordinator is ready!**

### Step 2: Verify Coordinator (30 seconds)

```bash
# In another terminal
curl http://localhost:3000/status
```

**Should see**: JSON with system stats (tasks, agents)

**✅ Coordinator is responding!**

### Step 3: Start First Agent - Agent C (1 minute)

**Why C first?** T018 (RAG Index) is HIGH PRIORITY and ready!

```bash
# Terminal 2
cd /Users/lech/PROJECTS_all/LocalBrain/04_AGENT_FRAMEWORK/agent-dispatch
AGENT_ID=C npm run autonomous:demo
```

**Watch for**:
```
🤖 Agent C - BACKEND SERVICES SPECIALIST
✅ TASK ASSIGNED: T018 - RAG Index
📝 Claiming task...
✅ Task T018 is yours!
💻 Working on task...
```

**✅ Agent C is working autonomously!**

### Step 4: Watch the Magic (2 minutes)

Agent C will automatically:
- Report 25% progress → System encourages
- Report 50% progress → System encourages
- Report 75% progress → System encourages
- Complete task → System issues KUDOS 🎉
- Check in again → Get next task or release

**✅ Full autonomous lifecycle working!**

### Step 5: Start More Agents (Optional, 3 minutes)

```bash
# Terminal 3: Agent A (UI)
AGENT_ID=A npm run autonomous:demo

# Terminal 4: Agent B (Design)
AGENT_ID=B npm run autonomous:demo

# Terminal 5: Agent D (Integration)
AGENT_ID=D npm run autonomous:demo

# Terminal 6: Agent E (Supervisor)
AGENT_ID=E npm run autonomous:demo
```

**✅ Multi-agent system running!**

## 👥 ONBOARDING AGENTS

### The 2-Minute Conversation (Per Agent)

**You say**:

> "Hey [Agent], we have a new system called Keep-In-Touch. It's like a telephone line - you check in with Central Coordinator, get tasks automatically, report progress, and receive recognition when done.
>
> To start: `cd agent-dispatch && AGENT_ID=[YOUR_LETTER] npm run autonomous`
>
> The system shows you exactly what to build, tracks your progress automatically, gives you kudos when done, and assigns your next task or releases you.
>
> Just code and commit. System handles everything else."

**Agent asks**: "What if I get stuck?"

**You say**: "Task card has all info. If truly stuck, ask me. But try system first - it's designed to guide you completely."

**Agent asks**: "How do I know when to stop?"

**You say**: "System tells you! You get a RELEASE message when all your tasks are done. Until then, keep cycling through tasks."

**That's it.** Agent is ready.

### Priority Order

1. **Agent C first** - T018 (RAG Index) is HIGH PRIORITY and ready NOW
2. **Agent A second** - UI tasks waiting
3. **Agent B third** - Design system tasks
4. **Agent D fourth** - Integration tasks
5. **Agent E fifth** - Supervision tasks

### Onboarding Checklist (Per Agent)

- [ ] Explained Keep-In-Touch concept
- [ ] Showed start command
- [ ] Demonstrated task card
- [ ] Practiced one cycle together
- [ ] Answered questions
- [ ] Agent started autonomously
- [ ] Agent completed first cycle
- [ ] Agent comfortable with workflow

**✅ Agent onboarded when all checked**

## 📊 MONITORING (While Agents Work)

### Real-Time Status

```bash
# Terminal with status updates
watch -n 5 'curl -s http://localhost:3000/status | jq'

# Or manual check
curl http://localhost:3000/status
```

**Shows**:
- Which agents are working
- What tasks they're on
- How many tasks completed
- System-wide progress

### Coordinator Logs

**Terminal 1** (where coordinator runs) shows:
```
📨 Received: CHECK_IN from Agent C
✅ Assigning T018 to Agent C
✅ Agent C claimed T018
📊 Agent C: T018 at 50%
🎉 Agent C completed T018! Velocity: 115%
```

**Watch this to see system managing agents in real-time.**

### Agent Terminals

Each agent terminal shows their own lifecycle:
- CHECK-IN → Task assigned
- CLAIM → Working
- UPDATE → Progress reports
- COMPLETE → Kudos received
- Next cycle

**Each agent is self-sufficient.**

---

## 🎯 WHAT TO EXPECT

### First 5 Minutes

- Coordinator starts successfully
- Agent C connects
- T018 assigned to Agent C
- Agent C works autonomously
- Progress updates appear

### First 15 Minutes (Demo Mode)

- Agent C completes T018
- Receives kudos
- Gets next task (T020 or next available)
- Starts working on new task
- Progress updates continue

### First Hour (Production Mode)

- Multiple agents working
- Tasks being completed
- Kudos being issued
- Automatic task assignment
- Zero manual coordination

### What Success Looks Like

**You're doing NOTHING except watching:**
- Coordinator assigning tasks
- Agents working autonomously
- Progress being reported
- Kudos being issued
- Tasks getting completed
- Dependencies auto-unblocking

**You only intervene if**:
- Agent reports blocker
- System error occurs
- Human decision needed

**Otherwise: HANDS OFF. System runs itself.**

## 🐛 COMMON ISSUES

### Issue: "Port 3000 in use"

```bash
kill $(lsof -ti :3000)
./start-coordinator.sh
```

### Issue: "Cannot find module"

```bash
cd agent-dispatch && npm install && npm run build
cd ../central-coordinator && npm install && npm run build
```

### Issue: "Agent can't connect"

1. Check coordinator is running: `curl http://localhost:3000/status`
2. Check coordinator terminal for errors
3. Restart coordinator if needed

### Issue: "Agent immediately released"

**This is CORRECT if**:
- No tasks available for that agent
- All agent's tasks are blocked
- All agent's tasks are complete

**Check**: `cat CENTRAL_TASK_REGISTRY.md | grep "Agent [LETTER]"`

---
