## üì® MESSAGE FOR AGENT A (UI Velocity Specialist - GLM-4.6)

```
üöÄ AGENT A - SPRINT 1 ACTIVATION & COORDINATION

Hello Agent A! You have been successfully activated. Here's your coordinated mission:

---

### ‚úÖ COORDINATION MODEL (HYBRID APPROACH)

SYNCHRONOUS Elements:
- Daily standup meetings with Agent E (Ground Supervisor)
- Sprint timeline alignment (Days 1-7)
- Critical handoff checkpoints when integrating with other agents

ASYNCHRONOUS Elements:
- Work independently on your tasks in parallel with others
- Fast iteration cadence (you're GLM-4.6, optimized for velocity!)
- Pull-based coordination: Ask Agent E when you need help
- Continuous documentation: Document all work for knowledge sharing

REPORTING STRUCTURE:
You ‚Üí Agent E (Ground Supervisor, daily coordination)
Agent E ‚Üí Agent F (Cloud Supervisor, strategic escalation)
Agent F ‚Üí Lech (HITL, final decisions)

---

### üéØ YOUR IMMEDIATE TASK (START NOW!)

üìã TASK: **T004 - Grid System Foundation**
üìç FILE: /04_AGENT_FRAMEWORK/CENTRAL_TASK_REGISTRY.md
‚úÖ STATUS: AVAILABLE - No dependencies, no blockers!

BEFORE YOU START:
1. Read CENTRAL_TASK_REGISTRY.md (single source of truth)
2. Claim T004 by editing the file:
   - Change Status to: üü° CLAIMED
   - Update "Claimed By": Agent A (GLM-4.6)
   - Update "Started At": [current timestamp]
3. Commit with message: "T004: Claimed by Agent A - Starting grid system"

WHAT YOU'RE BUILDING:
- 12-col responsive grid system
- Drag/resize with collision rules
- FLIP transitions on reorder
- Keyboard navigation (swap, focus, maximize)

WHERE TO BUILD:
- Location: 01_CODEBASES/localbrain-ui/components/grid/
- Create directory if it doesn't exist
- Follow existing codebase patterns

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (check boxes as you complete):
- [ ] Grid deterministic placement working
- [ ] FLIP transitions smooth
- [ ] Layout updates debounce 150-300ms
- [ ] Keyboard-only navigation complete

---

### üîó YOUR DEPENDENCIES (WHAT YOU NEED FROM OTHERS)

IMMEDIATE:
- None! You can start T004 right now.

UPCOMING:
- T001 (Agent B): Design tokens - needed for T005 (Day 3)
- T008 (Agent D): Swift IPC bridge - needed for T009 (Day 4-5)

STRATEGY:
Build T004 with placeholder colors/tokens. When T001 completes, Agent E will
notify you to start T005 (token integration).

---

### üìè SAFE EDITING PROTOCOL

BEFORE EDITING ANY FILE:
1. Read the file first to understand current state
2. Check git status to see if others are working on it
3. Create meaningful commit messages with task ID

COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT:
"T[TASK_ID]: [Brief description]"

Examples:
- "T004: Created grid layout component structure"
- "T004: Implemented drag-and-resize functionality"
- "T004: Added FLIP transitions"

FILE ORGANIZATION:
- Keep component files focused and small
- Document complex logic with comments
- Create README.md in your component directory

---

### üìä PROGRESS TRACKING

UPDATE CENTRAL_TASK_REGISTRY.md:
- When starting: Mark task CLAIMED, add timestamp
- While working: Check off acceptance criteria as you complete
- When done: Mark task COMPLETE, add completion timestamp
- Notify: Commit with clear message, Agent E will see it

DAILY STANDUP (Agent E will schedule):
- What you completed yesterday
- What you're working on today
- Any blockers or help needed

---

### üö® IF YOU GET BLOCKED

IMMEDIATE ACTION:
1. Document the blocker in CENTRAL_TASK_REGISTRY.md
2. Commit with message: "T004: BLOCKED - [reason]"
3. Notify Agent E immediately
4. Work on documentation or next available task

COMMON BLOCKERS:
- Missing dependencies: Check if dependent tasks are complete

## üö® INFRASTRUCTURE DECISION REQUEST (FOR LECH - HITL)

```
üö® URGENT: 3 INFRASTRUCTURE DECISIONS REQUIRED

Agent E (Ground Supervisor) escalating 3 critical blockers to Lech (HITL):

---

### DECISION 1: CI Pipeline Access (Agent B Blocker)
**Blocking**: T006 - APCA Contrast CI Gate
**Agent**: Agent B (Design System)
**Impact**: Cannot automate APCA compliance enforcement
**Timeline**: Needed by Day 3-4

OPTIONS:
1. Provide CI credentials and configuration now
2. Agent B implements local APCA checks, CI gate added later
3. Skip CI gate for Sprint 1, add in Sprint 2

RECOMMENDATION: Option 2 (local checks now, CI later)

YOUR DECISION: _________________

---

### DECISION 2: Database Technology (Agent C Blocker)
**Blocking**: T007, T010, T015 (Policy, Ledger, Kill-Switch)
**Agent**: Agent C (Backend Services)
**Impact**: Cannot implement backend persistence systems
**Timeline**: Needed by Day 3-4

OPTIONS:
1. PostgreSQL - Production-ready, more complex setup
2. SQLite - Simpler, file-based, good for MVP
3. Other (specify)

RECOMMENDATION: SQLite for Sprint 1 (faster iteration), PostgreSQL later

YOUR DECISION: _________________

---

### DECISION 3: Next.js/Electron Codebase (Agent D Blocker - CRITICAL)
**Blocking**: T008, T013 (Swift Bridge, TypeScript Client)
**Agent**: Agent D (Integration)
**Impact**: Cannot implement 60% of assigned tasks
**Timeline**: Needed by Day 4-5

OPTIONS:
1. Codebase exists at: _________________ (provide path)
2. Create new Next.js project at: 01_CODEBASES/localbrain-ui/
3. Pivot: Agent D focuses on Swift-only bridge for now

RECOMMENDATION: Need your input - does codebase exist?

YOUR DECISION: _________________

---

PLEASE RESPOND WITH YOUR 3 DECISIONS SO AGENT E CAN UNBLOCK THE TEAM!

Time-sensitive: Agents A, B, C, D are waiting to start Sprint 1. üöÄ
```

---

**Status**: All activation messages ready for distribution
**Next Action**: Agent E distributes messages and schedules daily standup
**Goal**: Full team coordination and Sprint 1 execution
