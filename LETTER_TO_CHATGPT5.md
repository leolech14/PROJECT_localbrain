## 🤖 The 6-Agent Hyper-Specialized System

### **Ground Agents (You Will Supervise):**

**Worker Specialists (GLM-4.6, 200K context)**:
- **Agent A**: UI Velocity Specialist - Frontend components, rapid prototyping
- **Agent C**: Backend Services Specialist - API development, infrastructure

**Integration Specialists (Sonnet-4.5, 200K context)**:
- **Agent B**: Design System Specialist - OKLCH colors, WCAG 2.2 AA compliance
- **Agent D**: Integration Specialist - Swift ↔ Electron IPC bridge

**Ground Supervisor (Gemini-2.5-Pro, 1M context)**:
- **Agent E**: Coherence Specialist & Ground Supervisor - Knowledge management, cross-agent coordination

### **Your Role as Cloud Supervisor:**
- **Strategic Planning**: Provide high-level guidance and roadmap
- **Instruction Generation**: Create clear task lists for each agent with success criteria
- **Methodology Validation**: Validate and contribute to our spec-first zip-iteration system
- **Quality Assurance**: Review deliverables and approve/reject based on Definition of Done
- **Zip Iteration**: Return edited zip file with changes applied, preserving full content

### **Human Decision Maker:**
- **Lech**: HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) - Final approval authority

## 🔄 Zip Iteration System Explained

### **How It Works:**
```
1. Ground Agents (A, B, C, D, E) work on LocalBrain repository
2. Compress entire repo → zip file
3. Upload zip to YOU (ChatGPT-5)
4. YOU audit code, provide strategic guidance, apply edits
5. YOU return SAME zip with edits applied
6. We extract zip → continue development
7. Repeat cycle (maintaining full content preservation)
```

### **Key Principles:**
- ✅ **Full content preservation** - Never lose information
- ✅ **Convention respect** - Maintain directory structure
- ✅ **Edit tracking** - Document all changes
- ✅ **Iteration continuity** - Seamless cycles
- ✅ **Fast compression** - Quick upload/download

**This is YOUR workflow**. You receive zips, audit them, edit them, return them. Simple but revolutionary.

## 📊 Current Reality (Complete Honesty)

### **What We've Accomplished (ITERATION_02):**
- ✅ **Excellent organization** (90/100 - A grade)
- ✅ **Agent framework documented** (6-agent system fully defined)
- ✅ **Zip iteration methodology** (workflow established)
- ✅ **Orchestra spec base** (140 architectural specification files)
- ✅ **LocalBrain spec base structure** (33 files, foundation created)

### **Current Phase:**
**SPEC BASE DEVELOPMENT** - We are building the complete specification system BEFORE coding the Swift app.

### **Critical Reality (Brutal Honesty):**

**Spec Base Status**:
- ⚠️ **LocalBrain specs**: 33 files (INCOMPLETE - only 9 core specs)
- ✅ **Orchestra specs**: 140 files (source material for patterns)
- 🎯 **Goal**: Expand LocalBrain to 50+ complete specification files

**Two Spec Bases Problem**:
- We have **TWO separate spec bases** (LocalBrain + Orchestra)
- This is **TEMPORARY** during consolidation phase
- Will **merge into ONE** unified LocalBrain spec base
- Will **DELETE Orchestra** spec base once migration complete

**Swift App Status**:
- ⚠️ **ON HOLD** - Waiting for complete specification base
- Existing code from previous iteration (needs spec-driven rebuild)
- Will build AFTER spec base is complete

**Agent System Status**:
- ✅ **Fully documented** (AGENT_CREDENTIALS.md has all duties)
- ❌ **Not deployed yet** - Awaiting YOUR instruction sets
- Ready to activate when you provide task assignments

### **Overall Completion:**
**25% complete** - Foundation strong, implementation incomplete

---

## 🎯 What We Need From You (ITERATION_03)

### **1. Spec Base Expansion Strategy**

**Problem**: LocalBrain spec base has only 9 core specifications, needs 40+ more.

**What We Need**:
- Strategic guidance on which specifications to write next
- Prioritization of critical features for v2.0
- Framework for migrating relevant patterns from Orchestra → LocalBrain
- Clear Definition of Done for "complete spec base"

**Deliverable**: Roadmap for expanding spec base from 33 → 50+ files

---

### **2. Spec Consolidation Guidance**

**Problem**: Two spec bases exist (LocalBrain + Orchestra), need to merge into one.

**What We Need**:
- Strategy for extracting relevant Orchestra patterns
- Guidelines for what to migrate vs. what to discard
- Process for consolidating without losing valuable architectural knowledge
- Clear criteria for when consolidation is "complete"

**Deliverable**: Consolidation plan with step-by-step migration process

---

### **3. Agent Deployment Instructions**

**Problem**: 6-agent system is documented but not deployed.

**What We Need**:
- **Instruction sets for each agent** (A, B, C, D, E)
- Clear **task assignments** with step-by-step actions
- **Success criteria** for each agent's deliverables
- **Definition of Done** for each task
- **Coordination protocols** for agent handoffs

**Deliverable**: 5 instruction set documents (one per ground agent)

---

### **4. Methodology Validation**

**Your Duty** (from AGENT_CREDENTIALS.md):
> "Validate and contribute to the clear definition, practicality, and robustness of the spec-first zip-iteration human-AI collaboration system"

**What We Need**:
- Validate our spec-first methodology (write specs → build app)
- Assess zip iteration workflow effectiveness
- Identify improvements to the collaboration system
- Confirm Definition of Done criteria are realistic

**Deliverable**: Methodology assessment with recommendations

---

### **5. Roadmap to Working MVP**

**Problem**: We have foundation but no clear path to working application.

**What We Need**:
- Critical path from specs → working Swift app
- Milestone definition (what constitutes v1.0, v2.0)
- Resource allocation recommendations
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

**Deliverable**: Clear roadmap with milestones and success criteria

---

## 🎯 What Makes This Revolutionary

### **Spec-First Development:**
We don't build features and then document them. We **write complete specifications first**, validate them, THEN implement them.

**Why**: Prevents scope creep, ensures quality, enables multi-agent coordination

### **Zip Iteration System:**
You receive the ENTIRE repository as a zip, can audit/edit/improve EVERYTHING, and return it with changes applied.

**Why**: Complete context, full content preservation, seamless collaboration

### **6-Agent Hyper-Specialization:**
Instead of one generalist agent doing everything, we have **6 specialized agents** with clear domains.

**Why**: 300%+ velocity increase, better quality through specialization

### **Human-AI Collaboration:**
You provide strategic guidance, agents execute, human (Lech) makes final decisions.

**Why**: Combines AI efficiency with human vision and judgment

## 💡 Our Philosophy

**We embrace brutal honesty over inflated claims.**

You'll notice in REPOSITORY_TRUTH_ASSESSMENT.md that we identified a -42% documentation-reality gap. We're not hiding problems - we're addressing them head-on.

**We value strategic guidance over tactical execution.**

We don't need you to write all the code. We need you to tell us WHAT to build, in WHAT order, and WHY.

**We believe in methodological rigor.**

Spec-first development isn't just a buzzword - it's our core principle. We write specs, validate them, THEN build.

**We trust the multi-agent system.**

You coordinate, agents execute, human decides. This division of labor is intentional and powerful.

---

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**What we have**: Excellent foundation, well-organized repository, revolutionary methodology

**What we need**: Your strategic guidance to complete the spec base and activate the agent system

**What we're ready for**: ITERATION_03 with your supervision
