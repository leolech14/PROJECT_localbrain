## Key Adaptations: Orchestra Blue → LocalBrain

### From Web to Native macOS

| Orchestra (Web) | LocalBrain (macOS) | Rationale |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| TypeScript interfaces | Swift protocols & structs | Native Swift type system |
| React components | SwiftUI views | Native macOS UI framework |
| npm scripts | Xcode build phases | Native build system |
| Environment variables | Info.plist + ProcessInfo | macOS configuration patterns |
| Prometheus metrics | SpecProbe event emission | Lightweight embedded telemetry |
| HTTP endpoints | Actor message passing | Swift concurrency model |
| REST APIs | MCP tool calls | LocalBrain's integration pattern |
| Web dashboards | JSONL logs + spec validation | File-based observability |

**Philosophy:** Keep Orchestra's rigor, adapt to Swift/macOS idioms.

---

## YAML Front-Matter Design

Each spec includes comprehensive YAML metadata:

### Core Identity
```yaml
title: "[Name] - [Description]"
module_id: "[unique_id]"
type: "module|scaffold|configuration|governance|operations"
category: "[subcategory]"
```

### Swift-Specific Additions
```yaml
swift_actor: "ActorName"
swift_file: "LocalBrain/Path/File.swift"
swiftui_view: "ViewName"
spec_probe_events: ["event.namespace.*"]
macos_entitlements: ["com.apple.security.device.audio-input"]
xcode_target: "LocalBrain"
```

### Maturity Tracking
```yaml
lifecycle: "dev|qa|prod"
state: "minimal|i1|i2|i3|complete"
seat: "prototype|mvp|scale"
```

### Observability
```yaml
observability:
  spec_events: ["module.operation.start", "module.operation.end"]
  metrics_captured: ["duration_ms", "success_count"]
  spec_validation: ["LB-MODULE-XXX.spec.md"]
```

### Security & Access
```yaml
security:
  keychain_required: true
  api_key_access: ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"]
  file_system_access: "read"
agent_capabilities:
  can_read: true
  can_write: false
  requires_approval: true
```

**Why This Matters:**
Rich YAML metadata enables automated compliance checking, spec validation, and intelligent spec discovery.

---

## Standard Section Structure

All 5 templates follow 12-section structure:

1. **Purpose** - Why this exists, scope boundaries
2. **Primary Features** - Capability commitments
3. **Architecture** - Internal structure, Mermaid diagrams
4. **Contracts** - Swift protocols, types, event schemas
5. **Sub-Components & Behavior** - Decomposition, interactions
6. **State Progression & Promotion Gates** - Maturity levels (minimal → i1 → i2 → i3 → complete)
7. **Production Implementation** - Xcode builds, deployment steps
8. **Security & Compliance** - AuthN/AuthZ, Keychain, sandbox
9. **Testing Strategy** - Unit tests, UI tests, spec validation
10. **Success Criteria, Performance & Observability** - SLOs, metrics, dashboards
11. **Agent Integration** - Agent capabilities, boundaries, approval workflows
12. **Integrations & References** - Dependencies, data flows, see-also links

**Why This Matters:**
Consistent structure makes specs scannable, comparable, and complete. No critical information falls through the cracks.

---

## Promotion Gate System

Every spec tracks maturity through 5 states:

### State Definitions

**Minimal:** Basic functionality works end-to-end
- Core implementation present
- Events emitting (if applicable)
- Unit tests passing

**Intermediate I1:** Reliable with error handling
- Error handling comprehensive
- Integration with orchestrator
- Spec validation passing

**Intermediate I2:** Advanced features and optimization
- Advanced features implemented
- Performance optimized
- Comprehensive test coverage

**Intermediate I3:** Production-ready with full integration
- Cross-module integration complete
- Edge cases handled
- Security audit passed

**Complete:** Battle-tested production
- Zero critical bugs
- SLA compliance verified
- Knowledge transfer complete

**Why This Matters:**
Promotion gates make quality measurable. No spec claims "production-ready" without meeting objective criteria.

---

## Observability Philosophy

### SpecProbe Event Emission

Every module emits structured events:

```swift
await SpecProbe.shared.emit("module.operation.start", [
    "id": .string(operationId),
    "params": .object(params)
])

// ... operation logic ...

await SpecProbe.shared.emit("module.operation.success", [
    "id": .string(operationId),
    "duration_ms": .number(duration),
    "result": .object(result)
])
```

### SpecRecorder Capture

When `LB_SPEC_COVERAGE_DIR` is set:
- All events → JSONL files
- Spec runner validates event sequences
- Executable specs verify behavior

### Validation Loop

```
Implement Module → Emit Events → Run Specs → Validate → Pass/Fail
```

**Why This Matters:**
Observability isn't an afterthought. Events are first-class citizens, enabling executable specifications and production telemetry.

---

## Agent Integration Model

Every spec defines how autonomous agents interact:

### Capabilities (What Agents CAN Do)
- Read module state
- Read configuration
- Propose changes via Change-Set
- Trigger low-risk operations

### Boundaries (What Agents CANNOT Do)
- Directly modify actor state
- Bypass security policies
- Access Keychain secrets
- Deploy to production

### Approval Workflow
- **Low-risk:** Auto-approved (logged)
- **Medium-risk:** Human approval required
- **High-risk:** Multi-signature or blocked

**Why This Matters:**
Agent integration is designed-in from day one. Clear boundaries prevent security issues while enabling productive AI assistance.

---

## What This Enables

### 1. Consistent Documentation
Every spec follows same structure → predictable, scannable, complete

### 2. Executable Specifications
SpecProbe events + YAML front-matter → specs that validate themselves

### 3. Automated Compliance
CI/CD can validate specs match implementation, track promotion gates

### 4. Knowledge Continuity
New developers get comprehensive understanding from specs alone

### 5. Agent Collaboration
AI agents understand capabilities, boundaries, approval workflows

### 6. Production Confidence
Promotion gates ensure nothing reaches production without meeting criteria

---

## Next Steps: Phase 2

### Immediate: Port Existing Specs

Migrate legacy specs to new format:

1. **DATA_POOL_ARCHITECTURE.md** → `1-mod/DATA_POOL.md`
2. **CONTEXT_SELECTOR.md** → `1-mod/CONTEXT_SELECTOR.md`

### Week 1: Core Module Specs

Write critical module specs:

- `1-mod/ORCHESTRATOR.md` - Central AI conductor
- `1-mod/DATA_POOL.md` - Unified context storage
- `1-mod/VOICE_METRICS.md` - Audio processing
- `1-mod/MEMORY_RAG.md` - Vector memory
- `2-scf/FILE_DRAWER.md` - Context file UI

### Week 2: Integration Specs

Document integration points:

- `1-mod/REALTIME_VOICE.md` - OpenAI Realtime API
- `1-mod/HIVE_MIND.md` - Multi-model coordination
- `3-cfg/API_PROVIDERS.md` - Provider configuration
- `4-gov/SPEC_SYSTEM.md` - Executable spec standards

### Week 3: Operations & Governance

Build operational foundation:

- `5-ops/XCODE_BUILD.md` - Build automation
- `5-ops/SPEC_RUNNER.md` - Test harness
- `4-gov/SWIFT_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architectural standards
- `4-gov/EVENT_EMISSION.md` - SpecProbe conventions

### Week 4: Validation & Compliance

- Run all specs against current LocalBrain build
- Measure compliance rates
- Fix gaps (implementation OR spec)
- Achieve >80% spec coverage

---

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- ✅ 5 category directories created
- ✅ 5 universal templates written (14,500+ lines)
- ✅ 12 standard sections per template
- ⏳ 15+ module specs (target)
- ⏳ >80% spec compliance (target)

### Qualitative
- ✅ Swift/macOS idioms respected
- ✅ Orchestra rigor preserved
- ✅ Agent integration designed-in
- ✅ Executable spec philosophy maintained
- ✅ Production-ready promotion gates

---

## Key Insights

### 1. Orchestra Blue's System is Excellent
Their 5-category approach, YAML front-matter, and promotion gates are production-proven. We're not inventing, we're adapting.

### 2. Swift ≠ TypeScript, But Patterns Transfer
Actor isolation → components, SpecProbe → Prometheus, SwiftUI → React patterns transfer well when adapted thoughtfully.

### 3. Specs Are Contracts
By defining events, protocols, and promotion gates explicitly, specs become executable contracts between modules.

### 4. Agents Need Boundaries
Agent integration isn't optional anymore. Every spec must define what agents can/can't do from day one.

### 5. Observability Enables Validation
SpecProbe events aren't just telemetry—they're how we validate specs match implementation.

---

## Conclusion

**Mission Accomplished:** LocalBrain now has enterprise-grade specification infrastructure adapted from Orchestra Blue's proven system.

**What Changed:**
- ❌ Before: Ad-hoc markdown docs, inconsistent structure
- ✅ After: 5-category system, YAML front-matter, promotion gates, executable specs

**What This Unlocks:**
- Consistent, comprehensive documentation
- Executable specifications (specs validate themselves)
- Agent-first architecture (boundaries designed-in)
- Production confidence (promotion gates enforce quality)
- Knowledge continuity (specs are source of truth)

**Next:** Start writing actual specs using these templates. The foundation is solid.
