  expectedBehavior: SecurityExpectation;
  actualBehavior: SecurityResult;
  status: 'pass' | 'fail' | 'warning';
}

interface SecurityExpectation {
  shouldBlock: string[];
  shouldAllow: string[];
  resourceLimits: ResourceLimit[];
  dataAccessRestrictions: DataAccessRule[];
}
```

#### Agent Permission Enforcement
```yaml
