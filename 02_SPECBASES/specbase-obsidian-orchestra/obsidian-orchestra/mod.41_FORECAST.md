  execute(params: ForecastParams): Promise<ForecastResult>
  validate(): Promise<ValidationResult>
  monitor(): Promise<PerformanceMetrics>
}

export class ProductionForecastEngine implements ForecastEngineImplementation {
  async initialize() {
    // Module initialization with security validation
    await this.validateForecastAccess()
    await this.setupModelConfiguration()
    await this.initializePredictionEngine()
  }

  async execute(params: ForecastParams) {
    // Core module functionality with error handling
    try {
      const result = await this.processForecastOperation(params)
      await this.validatePredictionAccuracy(result)
      await this.logForecastActivity(params.operation, 'success')
      return result
    } catch (error) {
      await this.handleForecastError(error, params)
      throw error
    }
  }

  async validate(): Promise<ValidationResult> {
    // Comprehensive validation suite
    return {
      modelAccuracy: await this.validateForecastModels(),
      predictionIntegrity: await this.validatePredictions(),
      dataQuality: await this.validateInputData()
    }
  }

  async monitor(): Promise<PerformanceMetrics> {
    // Real-time performance monitoring
    return {
      predictionLatency: await this.measurePredictionTime(),
      modelAccuracy: await this.measureForecastAccuracy(),
