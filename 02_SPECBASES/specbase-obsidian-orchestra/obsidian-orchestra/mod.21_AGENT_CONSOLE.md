# 21 Agent Console - Agent Control Center

## Purpose
The Agent Console serves as the primary control center for all financial agents, providing status monitoring, wallet management, action oversight, and approval workflows for autonomous economic actors.

## Primary Features
- **Agent Status Monitoring:** Real-time activity and state tracking
- **Wallet Balance Display:** Crypto and fiat wallet overview
- **Action Queue Management:** Pending and completed agent actions
- **Approval Interface:** Human-in-the-loop controls for agent decisions
- **Policy Configuration:** Agent constraint and permission management

## Sub-Components

### Agent Status Cards
- **Purpose:** Visual overview of each agent's current state
- **States:** Idle, Monitoring, Executing, Awaiting Approval, Paused
- **Information:** Last action, success rate, total transactions
- **Controls:** Pause/resume, emergency stop, configuration access

### Wallet Overview Panel
- **Crypto Wallets:** Balance display for all connected crypto wallets
- **Fiat Accounts:** Bank account balances and payment methods
- **Transaction History:** Recent agent-initiated transactions
- **Spending Analytics:** Agent spending patterns and optimization

### Action Queue Interface
- **Pending Actions:** Queue of agent-proposed actions awaiting execution
- **Approval Required:** Actions requiring human authorization
- **Execution Log:** History of completed agent actions
- **Error Handling:** Failed actions with retry options

### Policy Management
- **Spending Limits:** Daily/monthly caps per agent
- **Domain Restrictions:** Allowed websites and services
- **Approval Thresholds:** Automatic vs manual approval limits
- **Emergency Controls:** Immediate agent suspension capabilities

## Agent Types and Specializations

### Financial Advisor Agent
- **Purpose:** Investment recommendations and portfolio optimization
- **Capabilities:** Market analysis, risk assessment, allocation suggestions
- **Integrations:** External market data, investment platforms

### Bill Management Agent
- **Purpose:** Automated bill payment and subscription optimization
- **Capabilities:** Payment scheduling, subscription analysis, cancellation assistance
- **Integrations:** Utility companies, subscription services, payment platforms

### Tax Compliance Agent
- **Purpose:** Brazilian tax obligation management
- **Capabilities:** Tax calculation, filing assistance, deadline tracking
- **Integrations:** Brazilian tax authorities, accounting systems

### Shopping Optimization Agent
- **Purpose:** Purchase optimization and deal finding
- **Capabilities:** Price comparison, coupon finding, purchase timing
- **Integrations:** E-commerce platforms, price tracking services

## Contracts
### Agent Data
```typescript
interface AgentConsoleData {
  agents: FinancialAgent[]
  walletBalances: WalletBalance[]
  pendingActions: AgentAction[]
  recentActivity: AgentActivity[]
  policyViolations: PolicyViolation[]
}
```

### Control Actions
```typescript
interface AgentControlAction {
  agentId: string
  action: 'pause' | 'resume' | 'stop' | 'configure' | 'approve' | 'reject'
  parameters?: Record<string, any>
  reason?: string
}
```

## Interaction Patterns
- **Real-Time Updates:** Agent status changes reflect immediately
- **Approval Workflow:** Clear approve/reject buttons with reason tracking
- **Configuration Access:** Quick access to agent settings and policies
- **Emergency Controls:** Prominent emergency stop functionality

## Visual Design
- **Status Indicators:** Color-coded agent states with clear icons
- **Wallet Display:** Clear balance information with currency symbols
- **Action Cards:** Organized display of pending and completed actions
- **Control Buttons:** Prominent, accessible control interface

## Success Criteria
- Agent status updates in real-time without lag
- Approval workflow prevents unauthorized agent actions
- Wallet balances display accurately across all currencies
- Policy enforcement prevents violations before they occur
- Emergency controls respond immediately when activated

## Integration Points
- **Agent Layer:** Direct connection to agent runtime and management
- **Data Pool:** Consumes agent data and contributes control events
- **Approval Tray:** Coordinates with Change-Set approval system
- **Security Fabric:** Enforces agent policies and monitors compliance

  execute(params: ConsoleParams): Promise<ConsoleResult>
  validate(): Promise<ValidationResult>
  monitor(): Promise<PerformanceMetrics>
}

export class ProductionAgentConsole implements AgentConsoleImplementation {
  async initialize() {
    // Module initialization with security validation
    await this.validateAgentPermissions()
    await this.establishAgentConnections()
    await this.setupConsoleLogging()
  }

  async execute(params: ConsoleParams) {
    // Core module functionality with error handling
    try {
      const result = await this.processAgentCommand(params)
      await this.validateAgentResponse(result)
      await this.logAgentActivity(params.command, 'success')
      return result
    } catch (error) {
      await this.handleAgentError(error, params)
      throw error
    }
  }

  async validate(): Promise<ValidationResult> {
    // Comprehensive validation suite
    return {
      agentSecurity: await this.validateAgentSecurity(),
      commandValidation: await this.validateCommands(),
      permissionCheck: await this.validateAgentPermissions()
    }
