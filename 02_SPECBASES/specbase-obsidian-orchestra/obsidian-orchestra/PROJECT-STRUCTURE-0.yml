> Alright, now, if you had to create a set of markdown files to represent our app
   modules, what would be the criteria you would use to determine what becomes a 
  markdown file or not in our Obsidian Phenops folder?

  EXCLUSION CRITERIA (What DOESN'T get a markdown file):

  NO MARKDOWN FILE FOR:

  - Pure utilities (helper functions, formatters, validators)
  - Implementation details (specific API endpoints, database schemas)
  - Configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
  - Build artifacts (compiled code, bundles, etc.)
  - Temporary state (loading indicators, error messages)
  - Sub-components (buttons, inputs within a larger module)

  BORDERLINE CASES:

  - Theme Toggle: Part of Header component, not separate file
  - Upload Modal: Part of Header component functionality
  - Explanation Panel: Shared component, could be separate or part of AI Layer
  - Loading States: Part of individual module specifications

  ---
  MARKDOWN FILE CONTENT TEMPLATE:

  ---
  title: "Module Name"
  module_id: "unique_identifier"
  type: "frontend|backend|structural|agentic"
  category:
  "primitive|first_degree|default|advanced|backend|agentic|foundation"
  phase_availability: "always|post_onboarding|unlockable|expert"
  depends_on: ["module_ids"]
  provides_to: ["module_ids"]
  agent_assignable: boolean
  development_priority: "critical|high|medium|low"
  ---

  # Module Name

  ## Purpose
  What this module does and why it exists

  ## Contracts
  - Input data types
  - Output data types
  - Event subscriptions/publications

  ## UI Specification (if frontend)
  - Grid View behavior
  - Chip View behavior
  - User interactions

  ## Implementation Details
  - Technical requirements
  - Dependencies
  - Integration points

  ## Success Criteria
  - Functional requirements
  - Performance requirements
  - Testing requirements

  ## Agent Integration
  - How agents interact with this module
  - Required permissions
  - Available actions

  This structure ensures every significant architectural component gets proper 
  documentation while avoiding file explosion from utilities and implementation
   details.

> Okay, and how would you determine regarding to the things that didn't get to 
  become a markdown file? The pure utilities, the helper functions, the 
  formatters, the validators, the implementation details that are the specific 
  API endpoints, database schemas, the configuration files, package.json, 
  tsconfig.json, etc. The build artifacts, the compile code, bundles, etc., the 
  temporary states, the loading indicators, error messages, the subcomponents, 
  buttons, inputs within a larger module, and the borderline cases, the theme 
  toggle, part of header component, not separate file, or upload model that could
   be also part of the header component functionality, the explanation panel, 
  shared component. So these things do not become a markdown file, and this is a 
  problem until we find a way of categorizing all of these entities and to 
  correct place them within our framework of development that right now we are 
  using markdown files on an obsidian approach of visualizing our specifications 
  and our app specifications, really. Yeah, we are working on specifications, on 
  designing the architecture. So we are on a pre-dev phase, but already 
  developing, right? So we need to categorize these entities and to find a 
  correct place for us to place them that makes sense. So we are on a pre-dev 
  phase, but already developing, right? So we need to categorize these entities 
  and to find a correct place for us to place them that makes sense.

‚è∫ üìÅ COMPLETE ENTITY CATEGORIZATION FRAMEWORK

  Managing All App Components in Obsidian-Finops Architecture

  THE CATEGORIZATION CHALLENGE

  You're right - we need a place for EVERYTHING, not just the components that
  get their own markdown files. Here's a complete categorization framework:

  ---
  TIER 1: MARKDOWN FILES (Architectural Components)

  Components significant enough for individual specification

  Already Defined:

  - Structural Layer (00-06)
  - Primitive Substrate (10-15)
  - Module Layers (20-75)

  ---
  TIER 2: SPECIFICATION SECTIONS (Within Markdown Files)

  Important but contained within larger architectural components

  Within Module Markdown Files:

  module_internals:
    subcomponents:
      location: "## Sub-Components section in parent module"
      examples: [buttons, inputs, progress_bars, modal_dialogs]

    utilities:
      location: "## Utilities section in parent module"
      examples: [formatters, validators, helpers, converters]

    states:
      location: "## State Management section in parent module"
      examples: [loading_states, error_states, interaction_states]

  Example Structure:

  # 21_AGENT_CONSOLE.md

  ## Sub-Components
  - Agent Status Button
  - Wallet Balance Display
  - Action Queue List
  - Approval Modal Dialog

  ## Utilities
  - Currency formatter (BRL)
  - Agent status validator
  - Wallet balance calculator
  - Action priority sorter

  BORDERLINE CASE RESOLUTION:

  Theme Toggle:

  - Decision: Part of 01_HEADER_COMPONENT.md
  - Reason: Integrated UI element, not standalone module

  Upload Modal:

  - Decision: Part of 01_HEADER_COMPONENT.md
  - Reason: Triggered by header action, integral to header functionality

  Explanation Panel:

  - Decision: Part of 11_AI_LAYER.md
  - Reason: AI-generated content, shared across modules but owned by AI Layer

  Loading/Error States:

  - Decision: Section within each module's markdown
  - Reason: Module-specific behavior, not shared infrastructure

  Currency Formatters:

  - Decision: 81_UTILITY_FUNCTION_REGISTRY.md
  - Reason: Shared utility, referenced by multiple modules
