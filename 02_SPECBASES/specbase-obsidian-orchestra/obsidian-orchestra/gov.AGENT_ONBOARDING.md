## üéØ MISSION: UNIVERSAL AI-NATIVE FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE PLATFORM

You are joining the development of the **world's first agentic-native financial intelligence platform** - a universal personal finance management system that can accommodate any financial system of any size through AI-driven intelligence and modular architecture.

---

## üèõÔ∏è CORE ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ UNIVERSAL BY NATURE**
- **Accommodates ANY financial system** (personal, business, any size)
- **Context-driven approach:** User provides financial life context
- **Visual representation:** All financial entities displayed appropriately
- **Flexible yet structured:** Knows common financial elements but adapts to any structure

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ AI-NATIVE FROM BIRTH**
- **Built in the AI era** by AI-native developers using AI tools
- **AI is not a feature** - it's the foundation (flesh to bones)
- **Every component** designed with AI-first principles
- **Post-AI mindset:** AI capabilities are assumed, not announced

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ SINGULARITY ARCHITECTURE**
- **Single Orchestrator:** One AI conductor coordinates everything
- **Single Page:** One application shell contains all functionality
- **Single Data Pool:** All modules drink from and contribute to one source
- **Rule of Three:** Ideal number for human comprehension at every level

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ TIME-AXIS FINANCIAL MODELING**
- **Financial operations happen over time** (not continuous like Wall Street robots)
- **Timestamp precision:** Every operation tracked with exact timing
- **Graph-based visualization:** Nodes and connections showing transactions over time
- **Predictive modeling:** Extrapolate patterns to simulate future scenarios
