    await this.validateRuntimeSecurity()
    await this.setupAgentExecution()
    await this.initializeResourceManagement()
  }

  async execute(params: RuntimeParams) {
    // Core module functionality with error handling
    try {
      const result = await this.processRuntimeOperation(params)
      await this.validateAgentExecution(result)
      await this.logRuntimeActivity(params.operation, 'success')
      return result
    } catch (error) {
      await this.handleRuntimeError(error, params)
      throw error
    }
  }

  async validate(): Promise<ValidationResult> {
    // Comprehensive validation suite
    return {
      securityCheck: await this.validateRuntimeSecurity(),
      resourceCheck: await this.validateResourceUsage(),
      performanceCheck: await this.validateExecutionPerformance()
    }
  }

  async monitor(): Promise<PerformanceMetrics> {
    // Real-time performance monitoring
    return {
      executionLatency: await this.measureExecutionTime(),
      resourceUtilization: await this.measureResourceUsage(),
      agentHealth: await this.measureAgentHealth()
    }
  }
}
