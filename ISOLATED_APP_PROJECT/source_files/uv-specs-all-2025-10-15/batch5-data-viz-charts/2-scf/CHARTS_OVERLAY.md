## Purpose
Manage one or more chart overlays, their layout, legends, and exports.

## Layout
- Dock positions: left/right/bottom; draggable & resizable; snap guides.
- Pin/unpin charts; grid layout for multiple charts (2Ã—2, custom).

## Legends & axes
- Auto legends (color ramps, bin counts); axis ticks and labels; time formatting with locale.

## Export
- PNG snapshots with/without HUD; CSV/Parquet export of brushed/filtered rows.

## Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation; larger click targets; screen-reader labels on controls.

## Observability
- `uv.charts.overlay.add|remove|move|resize`, `uv.charts.export`

## Acceptance
- Drag/resize remains at 60 FPS; export PNG < 200 ms; CSV export writes 1M rows in < 3s (streaming).
