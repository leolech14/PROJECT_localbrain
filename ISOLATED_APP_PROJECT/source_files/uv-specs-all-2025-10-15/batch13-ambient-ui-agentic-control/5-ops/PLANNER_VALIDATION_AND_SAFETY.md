## Purpose
Guarantee deterministic execution and user control when an LLM proposes actions.

## Stages
1. Parse: map utterance → typed intent(s); confidence and rationale.
2. Plan: propose steps using only catalog tools; include invariants and expected diffs.
3. Validate: schema + permissions + invariants; compute dry-run; surface preview.
4. Confirm: explicit user consent (or policy auto-consent for safe ops).
5. Execute: dispatch to Operators; capture undo patches.
6. Audit: record all stages with correlation IDs; allow export.

## Failure modes & responses
- Ambiguity → ask clarifying question with multiple-choice intents.
- Rejection by guard → show reason and how to grant/adjust.
- Partial failure → rollback using undo patches.

## Metrics
- Plan success rate, guard rejection rate, undo rollback success, mean intent latency.
