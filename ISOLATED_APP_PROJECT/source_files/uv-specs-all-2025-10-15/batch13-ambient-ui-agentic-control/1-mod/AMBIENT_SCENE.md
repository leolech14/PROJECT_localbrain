## Purpose
Replace empty backgrounds with a subtle underwater ambience that conveys depth without distracting from content.

## Visual design
- Layers: gradient depth fog, slow caustics, sparse particles (parallax), optional god‑rays.
- Controls: intensity (0..1), motion (0..1), color theme (OKLCH-based), reduced-motion toggle.
- Modes: paused when any heavy scene renders; minimal mode for low-power.

## Implementation
- Single full‑screen pass (offscreen) → composited behind scene.
- Normal-mapped caustics from 3D noise; temporal smoothing to avoid shimmer; particle field with fixed budget.
- Target GPU cost ≤ 1.5 ms p95 at 2k viewport (budgeted).

## Accessibility
- Respect system reduce motion; provide color-blind safe presets.

## Observability
- `uv.ambient.enabled`, `uv.ambient.quality.changed`, `uv.ambient.ms`

## Acceptance
- Idle view holds frame budget; toggling ambient has no visual artifacts or z-fighting.
