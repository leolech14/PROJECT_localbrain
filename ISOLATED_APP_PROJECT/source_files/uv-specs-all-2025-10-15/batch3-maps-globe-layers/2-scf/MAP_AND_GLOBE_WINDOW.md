## Purpose
Define the behavior of the main canvas window for 2D/3D modes and user affordances.

## UI elements
- CRS badge (click â†’ change), scale bar, compass, zoom controls, attribution strip.
- 2D/3D toggle, terrain toggle, provider switch (quick pick from cfg/providers).

## Behavior
- Persist mode per project; copy camera/selection when toggling modes.
- Min/max zoom/tilt; optional "lock north up" and "constrain to ground".

## Accessibility
- Keyboard focus order; tooltip delays; larger hit targets for controls.

## Observability
- `uv.ui.mode.toggle`, `uv.ui.control.invoked`

## Acceptance
- Toggling 2D/3D with terrain on mid scenes stays above 45 FPS (p95) during flight.
