## Purpose
Provide a 2D map with imagery stacks and optional vector tiles, sharing the same Layer API.

## Data
- Imagery: XYZ/WMTS/WMS via Tile Source Manager.
- Vector tiles: MVT/PMTiles (mapped to vector symbology subset).

## Style
- Imagery: opacity, order, blend, color correction (brightness/contrast/gamma).
- Vectors: line/area symbolizers, color ramps by attribute, stroke/width, dash, labels (field/font/halo).
- Attribution: required credits rendered on HUD.

## Interactions
- Click/hover on vector layers (feature properties); imagery is non-pickable by default.
- Compare tools (swipe/spyglass) when two imagery layers are present.

## Transform
- 2D Mercator plane; CRS badge shows current projection; fits with reprojected inputs.

## Performance
- Tile prefetch within viewport + 1 ring; concurrency caps per host; GPU texture atlases for small overlays.

## Observability
- `uv.map.imagery.add|remove|reorder`, `uv.map.vector.tile.request|fail|throttle`

## Acceptance
- Reorder stack â†’ visual change < 50 ms.
- Vector labels declutter visibly; collision artifacts under 2% on test scenes.
