## Purpose
Automate quality and releases with clear stages, caching, and artifact management.

## Stages
1. **Lint & Typecheck** — ESLint/TS; schema lint (JSON Schemas).
2. **Unit** — fast unit tests, coverage thresholds.
3. **E2E** — Playwright/Cypress; headless Electron runs; screenshots for regressions.
4. **GPU Harness** — headful GPU tests on macOS runners with Apple Silicon.
5. **Benchmarks** — load perf scenes; record frame/IO/cache metrics; enforce gates.
6. **Package & Sign** — build artifacts; sign/notarize.
7. **Promote** — publish to channel (canary/beta/stable); upload symbols; create release notes.
8. **Docs** — build docs site; validate links; publish preview.

## Caching
- Node modules cache keyed by lockfile; build cache for intermediate artifacts; golden images as artifacts.

## Secrets
- Stored in CI vault (Keychain on macOS runners if needed); never printed; rotated regularly.

## Observability
- `uv.ci.stage.start|end`, `uv.ci.cache.hit|miss`, `uv.ci.artifact.uploaded`.

## Acceptance
- Full pipeline completes on a clean runner; all artifacts present; gates evaluated and enforced.
