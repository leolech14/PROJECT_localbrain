## Purpose
Deliver signed installers and updates across channels with symbolication and crash reporting.

## Channels
- `canary` → internal, daily; `beta` → external cohort; `stable` → GA.
- Cohort sizes & rollout percentages configurable.

## Packaging
- Electron builder config; universal binaries; DMG/PKG for macOS; auto-update prepared.

## Crash reporting
- Capture minidumps + source maps; symbol server; privacy redaction; user opt-in.

## Release notes
- Generated from commits + conventional changelog; upgrade guides for breaking changes.

## Observability
- `uv.release.publish|promote`, `uv.crash.reported|symbolicated`.

## Acceptance
- Auto-update roundtrip validated; crash symbolication demonstrated from synthetic crash.
