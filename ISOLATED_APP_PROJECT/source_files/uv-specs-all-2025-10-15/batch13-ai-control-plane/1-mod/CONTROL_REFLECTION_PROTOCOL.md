## Purpose
Enumerate and query controls exposed to AI; provide metadata, schemas, and safe actions.

## API
```ts
listControls(scope?:{widgetId?:string, panel?:string}) -> CCD[]
getControl(controlId) -> CCD
resolve(labelOrPath) -> controlId[]           // disambiguation returns list
subscribeControls(handler:(ev)=>void) -> Unsub
```
- Reflection is **read-only**; actions go through UCC.

## Performance
- Cache per widget version; incremental updates on panel changes; target â‰¤ 30 ms for `listControls` in common panels.

## Observability
- `uv.ai.control.reflect`, with counts and durations.

## Acceptance
- Querying the Style panel returns CCDs with correct schemas and constraints; resolve handles fuzzy matches with prompts when needed.
