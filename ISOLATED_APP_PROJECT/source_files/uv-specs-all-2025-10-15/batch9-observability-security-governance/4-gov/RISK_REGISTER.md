## Purpose
Track material risks, owners, severities, and mitigations with links to specs and issues.

## Template
```yaml
- id: R-0001
  title: Point cloud memory pressure
  category: Performance
  severity: High
  likelihood: Medium
  owner: Leo
  mitigation: "Point budget, eviction, density controls"
  status: Tracking
  links: ["batch4-3d-geometry-tiles-pointclouds/1-mod/POINT_CLOUD_LAYER.md"]
```
## Process
- Weekly review; statuses: Tracking → Mitigated → Accepted → Closed.
- Escalations surface in Logs/Perf warnings; action items link to issues.

## Acceptance
- Risk changes reflect in UI within session; owners notified (agent/webhook optional).
