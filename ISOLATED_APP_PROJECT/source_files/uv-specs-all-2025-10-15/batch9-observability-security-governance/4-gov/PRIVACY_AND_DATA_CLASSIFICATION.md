## Purpose
Provide clear **data classes** and handling rules that the app and specs comply with.

## Classes
- **Public** — sample datasets, telemetry without PII.
- **Internal** — typical project files, attributes not identifying individuals.
- **Sensitive** — any PII/PHI or regulated content; stricter prompts/log redaction.
- **Secrets** — tokens/keys; never persisted in projects or logs; OS keychain only.

## Rules
- Redact paths/usernames by default in logs; opt-in verbose with warning.
- Telemetry sampling disabled for Sensitive scenes unless explicitly enabled.
- Exports of data/models include a **provenance footer** (source hashes, time).

## Acceptance
- Classification banner visible per project; toggling class adjusts logging/sampling immediately.
