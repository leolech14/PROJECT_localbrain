## Purpose
Centralize **capability prompts** and policy enforcement for file and network access, respecting
the **Network Rules** (Batch 2) and user privacy.

## Capabilities
- **File system**: open/read/write/save-as within user-granted roots; hash log; recent list sanitized.
- **Network**: allowlist by domain; per-source headers/tokens via OS keychain; offline/captive modes.
- **Devices** (future): camera/mic for capture; explicit scopes.

## UX
- Clear, minimal prompts with purpose + scope + duration (once/session/always).
- "Why am I seeing this?" link to policy; audit log surfaced in Logs/Perf panel.
- Per-project remembered grants with revocation.

## Policy
- Deny by default; granular scopes; time-limited grants; audit trail with correlation IDs.
- Configurable via `4-gov/SECURITY_AND_PRIVACY_POLICY.md` and `3-cfg/NETWORK_RULES.md` (Batch 2).

## API (TS)
```ts
requestPermission(scope: "fs"|"network"|"device", opts:{reason:string, target?:string}): Promise<Grant>
revoke(scope, target?): void
grants(): Grant[]
```

## Events
- `uv.perm.prompt`, `uv.perm.granted|denied|revoked`, `uv.perm.audit`

## Acceptance
- Non-allowlisted network call is blocked with actionable guidance; grant lifecycle observable; audit exportable.
