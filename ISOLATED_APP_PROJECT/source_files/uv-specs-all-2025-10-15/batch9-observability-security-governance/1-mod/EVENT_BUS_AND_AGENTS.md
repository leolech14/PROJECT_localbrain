## Purpose
A lightweight **event bus** to subscribe to viewer events and forward selected ones to **agents**
(webhooks, local scripts) with backpressure and signing.

## Bus model
- Namespaces (e.g., `uv.render.*`, `uv.layer.*`, `uv.io.*`).
- Subscribers with filters and QoS (at-most-once / at-least-once semantics where applicable).
- Backpressure: bounded queues; drop-old policy with counters when saturated.

## Webhooks
- HMAC signature with shared secret; retry with exponential backoff; jitter; circuit breaker.
- Rate limits per endpoint; allow/deny lists; payload redaction options.

## Local agents
- Optional: JS scripting (Batch 11) can register handlers; sandboxed with timeouts.

## API (TS)
```ts
subscribe(pattern: string, handler: (e: Event)=>void, opts?:{qos?:string,maxQueue?:number}): Unsub
publish(e: Event): void
registerWebhook(id, url, secret, filter): void
```

## Observability
- `uv.agent.subscribed|unsubscribed`, `uv.agent.delivery.success|fail`, `uv.agent.drop`
- Metrics: queue depths, delivery latency p95, failure rate.

## Acceptance
- Burst of 10k events delivers within 2s with no UI jank; drops counted and visible when queues saturate.
