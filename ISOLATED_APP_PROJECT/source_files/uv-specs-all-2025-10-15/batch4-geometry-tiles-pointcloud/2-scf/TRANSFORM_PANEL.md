## Purpose
Make spatial hygiene explicit and easy: CRS selection, axis swizzle, units, alignment, and model matrix.

## Controls
- **CRS selector** (searchable EPSG); warnings on reprojection cost; show units.
- **Axis mapping** dropdown (XYZ permutations); **Units** (linear/angular).
- **Align to**: center, floor-to-ground, fit-to-layer; **Snap**: grid, vertex/edge/face, geographic.
- Matrix editor with reset/apply; deterministic "Fit to Layer" button.

## Behavior
- Changes create **Transform** patches for the Layer; undo/redo supported.
- Badges in HUD reflect CRS/units; tooltips explain applied transforms.

## Observability
- `uv.ui.transform.changed`, `uv.ui.transform.fit`, `uv.ui.transform.snap`

## Acceptance
- Fit-to-layer positions camera correctly on globe and local scenes; axis swizzle applies without geometry rewrite.
