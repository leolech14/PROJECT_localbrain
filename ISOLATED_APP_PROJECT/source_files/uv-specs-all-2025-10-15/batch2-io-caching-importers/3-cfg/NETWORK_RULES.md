## Purpose
Control who we talk to, how, and with what headers/auth.

## Allowlist & modes
- Allowlist of domains/patterns; **offline mode** (deny network) and **captive mode** (only local providers).

## Headers/tokens
- Per-domain header injection; token storage via OS keychain; renewal hooks.

## CORS
- Preflight handling guidance; suggest local proxy when needed (dev).

## Telemetry
- Opt-in only; anonymized; redact file paths; include explicit user consent in Settings.

## Acceptance
- Requests to non-allowlisted domains blocked with user-visible errors.
