## Purpose
Author and play back camera paths from bookmarks and/or keyframes; export recordings.

## Path authoring
- Build from **bookmarks** or manual keyframes; easing (cubic in/out, bezier), duration per segment.
- Constraints: terrain-following option; collision avoidance.

## Playback
- Preview at interactive FPS; scrubber with time cursor; loop controls.

## Recording
- Offscreen render path to worker encoder (**MP4/WEBM**); HUD on/off; dpi scale.
- Audio track optional (future); record selection highlights.

## Events
- `uv.camera.path.created|updated|played|stopped`, `uv.record.start|progress|end`.

## Acceptance
- 1080p 10s recording completes within expected time budget; UI frame times stay within budget.
