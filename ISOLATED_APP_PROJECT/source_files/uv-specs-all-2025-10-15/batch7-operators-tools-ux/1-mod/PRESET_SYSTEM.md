## Purpose
Save/Load **per-panel presets** and **full view recipes** (scene state) reproducibly.

## Presets
- Scope: Style, Data, Transform, Camera, Compare, Chart settings.
- Store: JSON with schema version; human-readable; diff-friendly.
- Location: project folder or user library with references.

## View recipes
- Snapshot Scene: layers (sources, styles, transforms), camera, HUD/compare settings.
- Shareable as JSON; can be applied partially or fully.

## Observability
- `uv.preset.saved|loaded|imported|exported`, `uv.viewrecipe.shared|applied`.

## Acceptance
- Preset apply < 100 ms for typical layer; view recipe rehydrates the scene deterministically.
