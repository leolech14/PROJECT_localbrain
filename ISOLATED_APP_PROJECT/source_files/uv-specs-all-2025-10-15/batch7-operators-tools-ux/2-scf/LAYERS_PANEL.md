## Purpose
Manage the layer stack: add/remove/reorder, group, visibility/solo/lock, counts,
and quick actions, with performance on large scenes.

## Features
- Drag-drop reorder with auto-scroll; groups with collapse/expand.
- Solo/lock/mute; mini-sparklines for counts/LOD; error badges.
- Context menu: duplicate, export, convert, isolate, fit-to-layer.

## Performance
- Virtualized list; handle 1000+ layers without jank.

## Observability
- `uv.ui.layers.add|remove|reorder|group|solo|lock`.

## Acceptance
- Reordering 100 layers remains responsive; actions emit correct events.
