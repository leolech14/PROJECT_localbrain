## Scope
Operators/Undo framework, measurement tools, snap & align, compare tools, camera paths/recording,
preset system, and the LAYERS/OPERATORS panels + Command Palette.

## Acceptance demos (for 'complete')
1. **Operator Discipline** — Execute, preview, cancel, and undo/redo for: style edit, transform, filter, and selection ops; history replay deterministic.
2. **Measure Suite** — Distance/area/angle/height work in 2D, 3D, and globe; geodesic distance matches reference within 0.5%.
3. **Snap & Align** — Translate a mesh snapping to vertex/edge/face; align geospatial feature to ground; grid snap toggles; undo stack correct.
4. **Compare** — Swipe and spyglass between two imagery layers; diff mode for raster; performance ≥ 45 FPS while dragging.
5. **Camera Paths** — Create 3 bookmarks; build a smooth path; preview; export a 10s MP4 at 1080p with HUD off.
6. **Presets** — Save and load a Style preset and a full View Recipe; applying preset is < 100 ms and updates are evented.
7. **UX Panels** — Layers Panel handles groups/solo/lock; Operators Panel shows running ops with cancel; Command Palette triggers any operator.

## Perf gates
- Operator latency (execute→apply) p95 < 50 ms for style/transform/filter ops.
- Compare swipe GPU cost ≤ 2 ms added; spyglass ≤ 3 ms.
- Recording uses encoder worker; UI frame time within budget during capture.

## Observability checks
- `uv.op.start|preview|apply|cancel|undo|redo`, `uv.measure.*`, `uv.snap.*`, `uv.compare.*`, `uv.camera.path.*`, `uv.preset.*`.
- Panels emit `uv.ui.layers.*`, `uv.ui.ops.*`, `uv.ui.command.*`.

## Risks & mitigations
- Complex undo payloads — store diffs for large datasets; cap history; snapshot keyframes.
- Hotkey collisions — keymap presets + conflict detector with suggestions.
